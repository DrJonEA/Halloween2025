# Halloween2025
Halloween Project for my [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@drjonea)

Using 8 WS2812B LEDs on a strip (well three strips joined together) and a 
[Waveshare RP2350 Amoled 1.64in Display](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2350-touch-amoled-1.64-m.htm?&aff_id=DrJonEA),
I've build a Peppers Ghost Illusion of adding a face to a Nazgul figure.

Code is included in this Repo for the Screen which also controlls the WS2812B LEDs via GPIO29.  I've also included the 3D Models.

My Thanks to 3DesignArt for their exceller [Nazgul Model](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/nazgul-3designart).
